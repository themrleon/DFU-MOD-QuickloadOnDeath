This is the source code for the Daggerfall Unity game mod called "Quickload On Death", which automatically quickload the game when player dies.

# What happens if I don't have any quicksaved game?
Nothing! since there isn't a quicksaved game, the mod can't quickload.

# How to use this mod?
Copy `"quickload on death.dfmod"` to your game mods folder `".../DaggerfallUnity_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods/"`
